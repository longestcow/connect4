# connect4
This project uses the negamax algorithm to find the best possible moves in connect4, with a bunch of optimizations - making it unbeatable (although the depth of the algorithm isn't big enough, so it's not exactly "unbeatable", just good at not losing) 
  
# how to run
I haven't made an executable file or anything, so your best bet for now is to just download the project files and compile it yourself
